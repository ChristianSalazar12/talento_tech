# 🔐 Password Security GUI App

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a GUI-based application that allows the user to:

- Register a password and generate token-based secure representations.
- Encrypt the password using a combination of algorithms (custom logic + Vigenère).
- Provide a mnemonic representation of the encrypted password.
- Perform login using encrypted or mnemonic password.
- Simulate brute-force attacks on the encrypted input using **César** and **Vigenère** techniques via the `stroke` module.

Built with **Python** and **Tkinter** for the graphical interface.
